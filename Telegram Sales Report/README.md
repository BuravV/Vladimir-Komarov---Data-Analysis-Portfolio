You work as an analyst at a startup in the field of adult English language learning. The company is growing fast, with a whole staff 
of marketers and salespeople coming up with new mechanics to engage users, improving commercial products.

Then there's the sales department. The staff calls potential customers and sells lesson packages. Except that marketing is not a friend of sales and the Head of Sales doesn't have beautiful end-to-end analytics. 
We need to help him.

The head of sales asks you to send metrics or graphs to his telegram every day. 
They should help him understand how things are going in the department, so to speak, to keep his finger on the pulse.

## Goals: 

1. Choose 3 metrics that will help the sales manager monitor the situation on a daily basis - whether everything is going well. Explain your choices.
2. Write a Telegram bot (script) that will send a daily report on these metrics to the manager in Telegram.
To show how the bot works, paste its code into your answer file and attach a screenshot of the message it sent so you can see who it's from.

## Solution 

Description of the solution can be found in the pdf file [**Telegram Sales Report**](https://github.com/BuravV/Vladimir-Komarov---Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/Telegram%20Sales%20Report/Telegram%20Sales%20Report.pdf). More datails including input/output data and source data are provided.
